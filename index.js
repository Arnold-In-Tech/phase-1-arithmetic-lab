// Write your code here


//1) is an equation whose multiplied results will equal 62

let num1 = 31;
let num2 = 2;
const multiply = (num1*num2);


//2) generates a random integer greater than 0
const random = Number.parseInt(Math.random() + 1, 10);


//3) is an equation that calculates a remainder that is equal to 4

let num3 = 22;
let num4 = 9;
const mod = (num3 % num4);


//4) will return 20 as the highest number in the set

let max = Math.ceil(19.8);
